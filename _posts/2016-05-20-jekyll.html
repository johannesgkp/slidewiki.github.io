<h3>Extending our developer website with a custom blog</h3>
<br>
<p>
As a catchy introduction for developers we created the SlideWiki GitHub page <a href="https://slidewiki.github.io">slidewiki.github.io</a>.
Because GitHub is a dream of a developer platform, we also want to use it to publish our inventions and hacks.
Thus <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> is the best solution in order to work with GitHub pages and multiple developers who want to publish content.
</p>
<p>
The following will descripe how Jekyll is used, how to write your Jekyll blog locally and why we don't use jekyll-bootstrap.
</p>
<i>
For me Jekyll is the same for GitHub pages as SASS is for CSS.
You write your content with help of the engine - e.g. modularity, reusability, linking - and it's parsed with the engine to your static content.
So you define the default style for types, tags it and write pages which handles all the content and style with <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki" target="_blank">Liquid</a>.
</i>
<p>
At the moment we have two pages, one as the entry point which the whole overview of what we think is interesting and the other which lists all blog entrys.
These are written in HTML and include both the well know <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> within <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> and <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>.
The blog entrys are also written in HTML to use the same style as the two pages.
We don't benefit from the features Jekyll can give us.
Only when we migrate our style from bootstrap to the Jekyll environment we will change this.
In order to add your blog entry just clone the repo:
<code>
git clone git@github.com:slidewiki/slidewiki.github.io.git
</code>
Add your new blog entry:
<code>
cp _posts/2016-05-19-example-post.html _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-name.html
</code>
Change the metadata and the content with your favourite editor.
Preview it with docker:
<code>
docker run --rm --label=jekyll --volume=$(pwd):/srv/jekyll --privileged=true -it -p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll
</code>
If you are satisfied with it push it to the repo:
<code>
git commit -am "added my blog entry" && git push
</code>
</p>
